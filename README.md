# Generator for Indoor-Outdoor Graphs (GIO.G)

GIO.G is an open-source and configurable tool designed to streamline the modeling process and reduce manual effort, enabling researchers
and practitioners to focus more on scenario exploration and analysis. GIO.G offers a systematic and automated approach to generating Indoor-Outdoor
Graphs based on user-defined environmental parameters. This scalability extends to large environments, making GIO.G suitable for a wide range of
urban modeling applications. The details of the information can be found in our paper: <TODO: Link to paper here>.
